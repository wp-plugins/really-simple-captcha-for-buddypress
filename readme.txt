This plugin integrates Really Simple Captcha to the Buddypress registration page. 

== Description ==
This plugin integrates [Really Simple Captcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/ "widely used captcha plugin in Wordpress") plugin to the [Buddypress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/ "BuddyPress lets users sign-up and start creating profiles...") registration page. Thus, its function is dependent on both of them.

= Why RS Captcha for Buddypress registration page? =
= - Number of Downloads =
By the time of writing, RS Captcha has already been downloaded 2,569,017 times by users of Contact Form 7 and plugin developers.

= - Less conflict with other plugins =
RS Captcha is supported by Contact Form 7 and other WordPress plugins. Running two or more Captcha plugins at the same time can cause undesirable effects on your site's performance. Why not choose the Captcha plugin with wide range of support?

= - Really Simple to use =
As the name of this plugin suggests, it's really easy to use. This plugin is just a little addition to the security of the Buddypress registration page.

= - Prevent piling up of pending users =
Users who don't activate their accounts, in the case of spammers, are still being recorded in the database as pending users. If you're one the people who don't like them piling up like that (like me!), then you'll love this plugin.



= Requirements =
Apparently, the activation of RS Captcha and Buddypress plugins is required for this plugin to work.
